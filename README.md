# ICS-503-Assignments
A starting point for ICS 503 assignments. 

I recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), the community edition is enough. 

#### Assignment 3: Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and Iterated Local Search
1. If using PyCharm, open the ICS-503-Assignments directory using PyCharm.
2. Fill the missing methods in [algorithms/single_state.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/single_state.py). Fill only the methods you need, e.g. `perturb()` is only needed by tabu search, so no need to implement it when playing with simulated annealing.
3. Run [experiment_runner.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py) to generate the plots and report. Remember to select your experiment algorithms by updating the [ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py#L12) list.

#### Assignment 4: Genetic Algorithm
1. If using PyCharm, open the ICS-503-Assignments directory using PyCharm.
2. Fill `get_initial_solution()`, `quality()` and `get_number_of_bins()` in [algorithms/single_state.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/single_state.py). 
3. Fill the missing methods in [algorithms/genetic.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/genetic.py). 
4. Run [experiment_runner.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py) to generate the plots and report. Remember to select your experiment algorithms by updating the [ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py#L12) list.
