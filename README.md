# ICS-503-Assignments
A starting point for ICS 503 assignments. 

I recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), the community edition is enough. 

1. If using PyCharm, open the ICS-503-Assignments directory using PyCharm.
2. Implement [`get_initial_solution()`](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/initial_solution.py), [`quality()`](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/quality.py), and [`get_number_of_bins()`](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/representation.py).
3. If using single-solution algorithms, you need to fill [`tweak()`](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/algorithms/tweak.py)
4. Implement the empty methods (if any) inside the file of the algorithm you want to use.
5. Run [experiment_runner.py](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py) to generate the plots and report. Remember to select your experiment algorithms by updating the [ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/Raed-Mughaus/ICS-503-Assignments/blob/main/experiment_runner.py#L14) list.
